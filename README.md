# album-ensembles
An album of computer-music performance, showcasing the [musicality](https://github.com/jamestunnell/musicality) Ruby gem. The songs begin as code for an internal DSL that is a blend between straight Ruby and a custom music notation syntax. The code is processed to produce the musical score objects, which are then prepped for computer performance by converting them to MIDI files.
